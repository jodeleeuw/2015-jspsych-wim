# Using jspsych to conduct behavioral research online
#### Tutorial presented as part of the 2015-16 Workshop in Methods series at Indiana University

The materials are intended to accompany the presentation, but you might find them useful even if you didn't attend the session. There are more materials in the repository than we will be able to cover in the two hour workshop. Hopefully having the extra materials is useful for learning on your own.

## Presentation Slides

[The tutorial slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v9ft1lBLbJjlnXx16OCPVRN5_e2-rIEPsSkGwIevbUM/) can be viewed on Google Drive.

## Repository Contents

### hello-world

This folder contains a working copy of the [hello-world example](http://docs.jspsych.org/tutorials/hello-world/) from the jsPsych documentation.

### lexical-decision

The lexical decision task example. There are three versions of the experiment in this folder.

* `experiment-instructions-only.html` contains a truncated version of the experiment with only the instructions trial.
* `experiment.html` contains the full version of the experiment as covered in the tutorial.
* `experiment-with-mean-rt.html` is an extended version of the experiment that shows how to access data generated by the participant to compute a mean response time for each condition and an overall accuracy score. These values are then displayed to the participant at the end of the experiment.

### plugin-development

This folder contains the `random-number` plugin example and a simple experiment that uses the plugin.

### advanced-design-patterns

Working examples of the "advanced design patterns" covered in the tutorial. These are examples that highlight different programming strategies for getting jspsych to do more advanced tasks.
